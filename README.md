This is the 2nd iterations of my personal website (Sean's Website) built with [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs)

## üöÄ Get Up and Running in 5 Minutes

You can get a new site up and running on your local dev environment in 5 minutes with these four steps:

1. **Install the Gatsby CLI.**

   ```shell
   npm install -g gatsby-cli
   ```

2. **Install packages**

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the site in `develop` mode.**

   Next, move into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up:

   ```shell
   gatsby develop
   ```

4. **Open the source code and start editing!**

   Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`. Open the website directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes, and the browser will update in real time!

At this point, you‚Äôve got a fully functional Gatsby website. For additional information on how you can customize your Gatsby site, see our [plugins](https://gatsbyjs.org/plugins/) and [the official tutorial](https://gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).

## ü§ù Forking and Use
This project may be used for any non-business purpose. I spent quite a bit of time developing and designing this website so feel free fork the repo, but if you do please link back my website for credits.

Also all images are mine, and have been taken by me. Please swap them out with your own.
